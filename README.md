# Apate ;;;; edition
A sub-version of Apate that converts empty messages into a sequence of randomly selected semicolons and hyphens to match the ancient communication method created by the god Nokyam in the Dawn Era.
It's said that Nokyam has the ability to read the intention of the writer by the pseudo-randomness of the writer's will and understand even the most complex sentences from just a single semicolon.

This project was created by Zeki, a student of Nokyam's divine language, with the intention of helping himself (and others that may come to use this futurely) to speak faster with the legend Nokyam himself.

# About Nokyam's language
As Zeki, student of the language for over 5 years, says:
> It's a deep language, with the fewest amount of characters you can express your whole being, even in only one character of truth.
 
Therefore it requires extensive study and years of practice to master the first steps of converting from your gutural language to this elevated language.

> Nokyam's language is uncomparable to other languages, not only does it not have any syntatic rules, as it also has no pre-defined meaning for any characters as in other languages.
> The meaning of words is defined by the intention of the writer in the moment of writing, and it is only capable of saying the highest truth.

> I don't understand anything.
